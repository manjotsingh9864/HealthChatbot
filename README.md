# ðŸ¤– HealthCare ChatBot

**HealthCare ChatBot** is an AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to simulate the predictions of a General Physician. It interacts with users in a human-like way, helping them understand symptoms, providing preliminary guidance, and recommending relevant specialists.

## :page_with_curl: Project Overview

A **chatbot** is a software program that can communicate with humans through text or voice. In this project, we focus on **diagnostics**, leveraging AI and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to create an interactive healthcare chatbot.  

This system helps hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers offer **24Ã—7 patient engagement**, guiding users, answering questions, and assisting with preliminary symptom analysis.

## :scroll: Problem Statement

During pandemics or busy schedules, patients often struggle to access healthcare promptly. Many elective or preventive check-ups are delayed, and misinformation may occur.  

**HealthChatbot** addresses this by providing:  
- Accurate preliminary guidance based on symptoms.  
- Recommendations for the appropriate doctor.  
- A safe, AI-assisted consultation alternative for users at home.

## :card_index: Features

- User registration and login system.  
- Console-based and GUI-based chatbot using **Tkinter**.  
- Diagnosis simulation using a **Decision Tree** model.  
- Suggests relevant doctors based on symptoms.  
- Easy-to-use interface for both patients and healthcare providers.

## :page_with_curl: Algorithm

**Decision Tree Algorithm** is used for symptom-based diagnosis.  

- A supervised learning technique for **classification problems**.  
- Internal nodes represent features (symptoms).  
- Branches define decision rules.  
- Leaf nodes represent predicted outcomes.  

This mimics human reasoning, making the diagnosis intuitive and easy to interpret.
